"Full stack Web application project"

Link for my project : https://sfashionworldapplication.herokuapp.com/
My name is Sajan Lawrence. I am pursuing my 3rd year B.Tech in Computer Science at Christ College of Engineering, Irinjalakuda. This is my first Full Stack Web Application project. I have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for front end design and Flask( Python framework ) for back end . The database I used in this project is Postgresql and my object relational mapper is SQLAlchemy.
